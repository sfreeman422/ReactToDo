# Pomotodo
Pomotodo is a to do list application designed to run on the Android/iOS and the web that takes advantage of the popular productivity technique called [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). This repository is for the web component of Pomotodo. For more information on the mobile component, please [view this repository](https://github.com/sfreeman422/ReactNativeToDo),

# Purpose
Pomotodo is designed to allow users to easily maintain their to-do list items across all devices, while at the same spotime, providing them with an easy to use Pomodoro timer. 

Upon creation of a task, users will be able to set a due date, determine the priority of the task, and decide whether or not this task will be something that requires a Pomodoro timer or not.
